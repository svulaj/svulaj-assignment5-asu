# SER316 Farm Simulator
By: Shaun Vulaj

## Design Patterns:
		 Abstract Factory: Plan on using this for the animals since they will mainly have the 			           same functionality(for the most part at least). Health, harvest(						pigs = truffles or bacon, cows = milk, chickens = eggs) same with 					  the crops.

		 Decorator: I think the decorator will be good to handle the abilities that are 				 available to the farmer when upgrades occur. For instance when a farm 				 recieves a cheese maker ability from the farm getting the upgrade (i just 				made this up, a barn) where now they can have cows, they will also be 				 able to milk and then make the cheese. So this fuctionality will need to			  be added to the currently existing farm.

		 Builder - I think this pattern will aid in the ability to add on to farms. As 				upgrades come in the farmers farm will need to be upgraded and i believe 			 thise pattern will aid in the addition process.
